## Linux Environment
For this research exploration, I'll be editing gem5 within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Debian as my Linux distribution. For more information on setting up WSL, see [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Git
I will be using Git as my version control system with GitHub as my platform, this means that all my changes to my forked gem5 repo will be organized and timestamped. My gem5 repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Tep1g/gem5).
